I personally love the Mahabharata. I’m currently reading the entire version available on the Internet Archive, translated by Shripad Damodar Satwalekar ji. I’m doing this to go beyond the edited versions — to understand what’s missing, the real context, and the true story.

I’ve noticed that many people, especially in India, prefer to watch the Mahabharata series rather than read the whole text. Reading requires deep interest and effort, while watching demands much less. The difference lies in the imagination — reading makes you visualize everything in your mind, whereas watching shows it directly before your eyes.

Anyway, I have created a website to reach those people who find it difficult to understand the real story behind different places mentioned in the Mahabharata. I may not know everything about these locations, because for many of them, the information varies — some people say it’s based on history, while others say it’s what their elders have passed down through generations.

That’s why I’ve provided some backstories about what people say regarding these places geographically, along with a bit of my own research. If you find any information that turns out to be inaccurate, I sincerely apologize — because this is exactly what has been lost or forgotten in our country, and I’m simply trying to turn my research into something positive and genuine.
