    <h4>If you love history and nature together, you should definitely visit Bhimkund—also known as Neelkund. This unique destination is a blend of natural beauty and Mahabharata-era mythology. According to legend, during their 13‑year exile, the Pandavas and Draupadi traversed this region. When Draupadi grew parched, Bhima (one of the Pandavas) struck the ground with his mace, creating a pond that sprang forth and quenched her thirst. That very pool remains today as Bhimkund.
    Stories say that Draupadi fainted from thirst, prompting Bhima to act. His powerful strike opened the earth, and water gushed out into a natural pond—its striking indigo-blue waters surrounded by red stone walls still visible in a cave about three metres from the entrance. To this day, its exact depth remains unknown. </h4>
    <h3>3.kaimur hills, madhya pradesh</h3>
    <h4>The Kaimur Hills,spanning parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, hold deep mythological significance in the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

    <h3>ancient mound amin, abhimanyupur</h3>
    <h4>Abhimanyu Ka Tila, also known as Abhimanyu’s Mound, is a place that tells the brave story of the Mahabharata hero Abhimanyu, who died at the age of 16 on the 13th day of the Kurukshetra war. This site symbolizes the courage of a young warrior who played a crucial role in ensuring the victory of the Pandavas.

    Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna and Subhadra, and the nephew of Krishna and Balarama. On the 13th day of the war, when Dronacharya designed the deadly Chakravyuh (Padmavyuh) formation, no one in the Pandava army knew how to break it—except Abhimanyu. Though he knew how to enter the formation, he did not know how to exit it.

    According to legend, when Arjuna was explaining the Chakravyuh strategy to Subhadra (while she was pregnant), Abhimanyu, still in the womb, listened to the part about how to enter it. But before Arjuna could explain the way out, Subhadra fell asleep—so Abhimanyu never heard the full strategy.

    Despite this, Abhimanyu bravely entered the Chakravyuh and fought against six of the greatest Kaurava warriors, defeating many of them. However, trapped and alone, he was eventually killed.

    Today, this historical and mythological place is believed to be located in abhimanyupur village,district of Haryana,India, where the Chakravyuh is said to have been formed.</h4>
