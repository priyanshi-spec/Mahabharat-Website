        This place is associated with the story of how Duryodhana tried to kill the Pandava brothers by setting the Lakshagriha (House of Lacquer) on fire. However, they escaped through a tunnel and stayed here for several days. It served as a temporary shelter to the Pandavas, which is why it is called Pandav Sthan.

    <h4>Abhimanyu Ka Tila, also known as Abhimanyu’s Mound, is a place that tells the brave story of the Mahabharata hero Abhimanyu, who died at the age of 16 on the 13th day of the Kurukshetra war. This site symbolizes the courage of a young warrior who played a crucial role in ensuring the victory of the Pandavas.

    Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna and Subhadra, and the nephew of Krishna and Balarama. On the 13th day of the war, when Dronacharya designed the deadly Chakravyuh (Padmavyuh) formation, no one in the Pandava army knew how to break it—except Abhimanyu. Though he knew how to enter the formation, he did not know how to exit it.

    According to legend, when Arjuna was explaining the Chakravyuh strategy to Subhadra (while she was pregnant), Abhimanyu, still in the womb, listened to the part about how to enter it. But before Arjuna could explain the way out, Subhadra fell asleep—so Abhimanyu never heard the full strategy.

    Despite this, Abhimanyu bravely entered the Chakravyuh and fought against six of the greatest Kaurava warriors, defeating many of them. However, trapped and alone, he was eventually killed.

    Today, this historical and mythological place is believed to be located in abhimanyupur village,district of Haryana,India, where the Chakravyuh is said to have been formed.</h4>

<h4>Lakshagriha (The House of Lac) is a famous incident from the Mahabharata. Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, had been crowned Prince of Hastinapura. Out of jealousy, Duryodhana and Shakuni plotted against the Pandavas. They ordered the architect Purochana to build a palace made of flammable materials—lac, grass, ghee, and bamboo.
When the Pandavas and their mother visited and stayed there for about one year, Purochana and his wife set the palace on fire. However, Bhima fought them, killed them, and the Pandavas escaped through a tunnel. Everyone believed that the Pandavas had perished in the inferno.The currently identified location of Lakshagriha (the House of Lac) is widely believed to be Barnawa village in Baghpat district, Uttar Pradesh, India.
